<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Luca. I'm a chilled out guy who loves nature and is a bit of a nerd. I have two older brothers and an older sister 
  (I know, I'm the baby)</p>

<p>I have a strong passion for Science and Technology and I believe the world is a better place because of it
  I am learning to code because it allows me to use my brain everyday and learn, it also allows me to make a real difference
  to peoples lives each time I tap a key
